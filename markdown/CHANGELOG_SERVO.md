# 🔄 CHANGELOG - Continuous Rotation Servo Update

## Summary of Changes

The system has been updated to use a **continuous rotation servo** instead of a standard positional servo. The motor now **continuously rotates** when turned ON, and you control its **rotation speed** (not angle) using gestures.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Positional Servo):
- ❌ Servo moved to specific angles (0-180°)
- ❌ Held position at each level
- ❌ Used for: pointing, positioning

### After (Continuous Rotation):
- ✅ Servo rotates continuously like a motor
- ✅ Speed controlled by PWM (5 levels)
- ✅ Used for: wheels, fans, conveyors, continuous motion

## 🔌 Hardware Changes

### Required Hardware:

**Option 1: Buy Continuous Rotation Servo (Recommended)**
- FS90R (Feetech) - ~$8-12
- SM-S4303R (SpringRC) - ~$7-10
- Parallax Continuous Rotation Servo - ~$15
- TowerPro MG90D - ~$10-15

### Wiring (Same as Before):
```

5V (Pin 2 or 4)  → Power Wire (Red)
GND (Pin 6)      → Ground Wire (Brown/Black)
```

## 🎮 Control Behavior

### LED Control (Unchanged):
| Level | Brightness |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | 20% |
| 2 | 40% |
| 3 | 60% (default) |
| 4 | 80% |
| 5 | 100% |

### Motor Control (Changed):
| Level | Rotation Speed | Status |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| 0 | Stopped | Motor OFF |
| 1 | 20% | Slow rotation |
| 2 | 40% | Low-medium |
| 3 | 60% (default) | Medium rotation |
| 4 | 80% | Fast rotation |
| 5 | 100% | Maximum speed |

**Key Difference**: Motor keeps rotating continuously, doesn't stop at positions

---

## 🎯 Gesture Controls (Unchanged)

All gestures work exactly the same:
- ☝ Number 1: Switch to LED mode
- ✌ Number 2: Switch to Motor mode
- ✋ Open Hand: Turn device ON
- ✊ Closed Fist: Turn device OFF
- 👍 Thumbs Up (2s): Increase speed/brightness
- 👎 Thumbs Down (2s): Decrease speed/brightness

---

## 💻 Code Changes Detail

### PWM Duty Cycle Mapping:

**Before (Positional Servo):**
```python
# Angle control: 2-12% duty cycle
angle = (level / 5.0) * 180  # 0-180 degrees
duty_cycle = 2 + (angle / 180.0) * 10
```

**After (Continuous Rotation):**
```python
# Speed control: 7.5-12% duty cycle
base_stop = 7.5  # Neutral (stopped)
max_forward = 12.0  # Maximum forward speed
duty_cycle = base_stop + (level / 5.0) * (max_forward - base_stop)
```

### Key Technical Details:

1. **Neutral Position**: 7.5% duty cycle = motor stopped
2. **Forward Rotation**: 7.5% → 12% = increasing speed
3. **Reverse Rotation**: 7.5% → 5% = reverse speed (not used in this project)
4. **Continuous Signal**: PWM signal continuously sent (not just pulses)

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Run Simulation (No Hardware)
```bash
python gesture_control_simulation.py
```
- Switch to motor mode (show 2 fingers)
- Turn motor ON (open hand)
- Observe rotating animation
- Increase/decrease speed (thumbs up/down for 2s)

### Test 2: Test Servo Hardware (Raspberry Pi)
```bash
# Create and run test_servo.py (see SERVO_GUIDE.md)
sudo python3 test_servo.py
```
- Servo should stop initially
- Should rotate slowly, then faster
- Should stop at end

### Test 3: Full System (Raspberry Pi)
```bash
python gesture_control_system.py
```
- Show 2 fingers (motor mode)
- Open hand (motor starts rotating)
- Thumbs up/down (speed changes)
- Closed fist (motor stops)

---

## 🔧 Calibration (If Needed)

If motor doesn't stop perfectly at neutral:

1. Edit `gesture_control_system.py`
2. Find line ~198: `base_stop = 7.5`
3. Adjust value:
   - Motor drifts forward → increase (try 7.6-8.0)
   - Motor drifts reverse → decrease (try 7.0-7.4)
4. Save and test again

---

## 🎨 Visual Changes

### Simulation Visualization:

**Before:**
- Servo arm pointing at different angles
- Static positions
- Showed angle in degrees

**After:**
- Servo arm continuously rotating
- Animated motion (speed-dependent)
- Shows rotation speed percentage
- "ROTATING >>" indicator
- Multiple arms for visual effect

---

## 📊 Compatibility

- ✅ Any continuous rotation servo (FS90R, SM-S4303R, etc.)
- ✅ Modified SG90 (feedback removed)
- ✅ DC motors with servo-style control
- ✅ Raspberry Pi 5 (and older models)

### Does NOT Work With:

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Motor won't stop"
→ Adjust `base_stop` value (see Calibration section)

### "Motor rotates opposite direction"
→ That's okay! Swap the duty cycle range in code

### "Motor is too slow/fast"
→ Adjust `max_forward` value (try 10.0-12.0)

### "Raspberry Pi reboots when motor runs"
→ Use external 5V power supply for servo

### "Motor jitters or buzzes"
→ Check power supply, add capacitor across power pins

### "Standard SG90 doesn't work"
→ You need continuous rotation servo (see SERVO_GUIDE.md)

## 🎓 Learning Points

Key concepts to understand:

1. **Positional vs Continuous Servo**
   - Position: moves to angle and holds
   - Continuous: rotates like a motor

2. **PWM Control**
   - Positional: 2-12% = 0-180°
   - Continuous: 5-7.5-10% = reverse-stop-forward

3. **Speed Control**
   - Duty cycle determines rotation speed
   - 7.5% = neutral (stopped)
   - Higher/lower = faster rotation

4. **Continuous Signal**
   - Motor needs constant PWM signal
   - Not just position pulses
   - Keep signal active when rotating
